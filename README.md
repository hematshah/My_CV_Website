My CV website

The aim of this website is to show my capabilities as an self thought individual
that I can build my own website both front and back-end. This website also serves
another purpose, which is to display my personal webpage CV to those individuals who
are looking to recruit me. I am open to all type of IT/ Developer related jobs.

 Thank you


 P.s: I am open to any feedback both on my website and my CV.
